# Marketo

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Marketo to Census and create your first sync.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your Marketo account ready, with admin access to create API-only users and API credentials.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
  * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)
  * [Rockset](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/rockset)
  * [Snowflake](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/snowflake)

### 1. Create a Marketo API User

Before setting up API credentials for Census, you'll first need a Marketo Role with API Access, as well as a user with that role.

#### API Access Role

None of the default Marketo Roles have API access so if this is your first API integration, you'll first need to create an API access role. [Marketo's documentation walks through creating a new API Access role](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/custom-services/) as well as your first user.

Whether you're using an existing role or creating a new one, please make sure it has at least the following permissions: **Read-Write People** and **Read-Write Named Accounts**. To use Custom Objects, we'll also need **Read-Write Custom Object** and **Read-Write Custom Object Type**.

You can view/edit role permissions in **Admin, Users & Roles**, then clicking the **Roles** tab.

#### API Only User

We recommend you create a new Marketo API User so that you can track changes made by your Census syncs. Either way, the user must be marked **API Only** during creation.

### 2. Gather Marketo API Credentials

To connect Census to Marketo, you'll need to collect three pieces of information:

* Endpoint URL
* Client ID
* Client Secret

Back in **Admin**, expand the **Integrations** menu on the left and select the **Web Services** option. Scroll down to the **REST API** section. Copy and paste the **Endpoint URL** \(you can excluding the `/rest` part\).

Next we'll create a new LaunchPoint Service. Click on **LaunchPoint** and select **New** &gt; **New Service.**

Your new service should have the following properties:

* Display Name: Census
* Service: **Custom**
* Description: Census Data Integration
* API Only User: _\[The user you created in step 1\]_

Once created, you'll see your new service in the list of services. Click on **View Details**. You will need to copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** here.

### 3. Adding Credentials to Census

With all three pieces of information, return to Census and visit the **Connections** tab. Click on the **Add Service** button and select **Marketo** from the menu. Copy and paste the values into the dialog and hit save. You should be clear to create a new sync!
