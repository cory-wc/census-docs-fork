Once you've authorized Census, you'll be redirected back to the Connections page in Census and you should see your Slack connection there.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Census to your data source

See our docs for each supported data source for further information:

* [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
* [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
* [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
* [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
* [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create your first Census model

Navigate to the **Models** page in Census and click the **Add Model** button.

Here you can a write SQL query to select the data you want to send to Slack.

Once you have created your model, give it a useful name, and click **Save Model**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create your first Census sync

Navigate to the **Syncs** page in Census and click the **Add Sync** button.

Follow the instructions below as you go through each section:

### üìÑ What data do you want to sync?

* For **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2.
* For **Source**, select the model you created in step 3.

### üìÑ **Where do you want to sync data to?**

* For **Connection**, select Slack.
* For **Object**, select the Slack channel you would like to sync data to.

### üìÑ **How should changes to the source be synced?**

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, **Append** is the only option available for Slack, so it will be automatically selected.
{% endhint %}

### üìÑ **How are source records identified?**

* Pick the column that uniquely identifies each record in your data source. Census will use this to identify new records that need to be synced to Slack.

### üìÑ **Which fields should be updated?**

* Select the additional fields you want to sync to Slack using **Add Mapping**.
* If you want to quickly select all the fields from your model in step 3, click on the **Multiple** dropdown and select **All From Source**.

### üìÑ Should existing data be synced?

* Since **Append** is the only sync behavior option available for Slack, you can decide if existing records in source should be sent to destination.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Backfill All Records** will be selected by default. Census will send records to a Slack channel one at a time, so if you have a high data volume that might clutter your Slack channel, consider changing the selection to **Skip Current Records**.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-09-13-at-10.44.42-am.png)

### üìÑ Would you like to test your sync?

* Click the **Run Test** button to test whether your sync successfully sends a single record from your data source to Slack.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Finishing touches

* Click the **Next** button to see the final preview of the sync settings. If you selected **Skip Current Records** in the **Should existing data be synced?** section, it should look something like this:

* To run the sync now, select the **Run a sync now?** checkbox and click the **Create Sync** button. Your sync is in now progress! 

## 5. Confirm the data is in Slack

In Slack, go to the channel that you set up the sync to.

If everything went well, you should see your data there:
